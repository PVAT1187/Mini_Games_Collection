# Mini Games Collection (C++ Console Application)

A simple command-line Mini Games Collection built in C++ using Visual Studio.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, along with
shared game logic, and modular project design through two classic games: Tic Tac Toe and Rock Paper Scissors.

---

# Design Overview
This project was created to explore how gameplay mechanics can be represented through modular systems and shareable code structures. My goal was to create a simple collection of mini games that share common architecture while maintaining their own unique rules and interactions
   - Tic Tac Toe: Focused on creating strategic play, managing players turns and game flow
   - Rock Paper Scissors: Designed for quick, repeatable gameplay with focus on randomness, and player engagement
   - System Design: Shared base classes handle setup, input validation, and turn management, ensuring scalability for new        games in the future

---

# Design Goals 
- Explore and gain hands-on experience in gameplay development
- Practice building systems that separate game logic from presentation (UI)
- Create a flexible architecture where new games can be added easily

## How to Build and Run
### Windows (Visual Studio)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PVAT1187/MiniGames_Collection.git
2. Open MiniGamesCollection.sln in Visual Studio
3. Build and run

### Command Line (if using g++)
1. Ensure you have g++ with C++17 support:
2. Copy the code below:
  ```bash
  g++ -std=c++17 -o MiniGames main.cpp GameMenu.cpp TicTacToe.cpp RockPaperScissors.cpp GameInterface.cpp TicTacToeInterface.cpp RockPaperScissorsInterface.cpp
  ./MiniGames
  ```
